## Features
* Send push notifications to APNS (Apple Push Notification Service) very easily (no configuration needed at all)
* Load / Save documents including token and JSON payload
* Grabs the certificate right from your keychain
* Get the device token automatically; forget about manually retrieving the device token through logging or similar techniques. Even more useful when not in sandbox mode (requires [Knuff-Framework](https://github.com/KnuffApp/Knuff-Framework))
* Support for error response codes
* Detects Development/Production environment automatically
* Supports universal certificates
* Custom JSON payloads
* Identity export to PEM format (âŒ˜ + E)

## Knuff iOS App

We created an iOS companion app to make it even easier to get up and running with APNs, download it from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/knuff-the-apns-debug-tool/id993435856).

## Usage of automatic token detection (iOS8+)
